# Whodey Do – Task Marketplace for Nigerians in the Diaspora (In progress)

**Whodey Do** (Pidgin for "Who does this?") is a simple task-based marketplace inspired by platforms like TaskRabbit, but designed specifically for **Nigerians living abroad** who need help with everyday tasks.

Whether it’s finding someone to help fix your sink, deliver home-cooked food, or assist with childcare, Whodey Do connects trusted individuals within the Nigerian community to get things done.

## Why Whodey Do?

Nigerians in the diaspora often face challenges navigating new systems, finding culturally familiar services, or simply getting trusted help. Whodey Do aims to fill that gap by creating a localized, community-first marketplace that:
- Prioritizes trust and cultural understanding
- Encourages economic empowerment within the diaspora
- Offers a more personalized alternative to mainstream gig platforms

## Features

- User authentication and profile management
- Post and browse tasks (e.g. handyman work, delivery, errands)
- Bidding and acceptance system for task fulfillment
- Location-based filtering (city/region support)
- Task status tracking and completion confirmation
- Messaging system between task posters and doers

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (based on implementation)
